            History — “Where We Started”
        </h2>
        <p class="pk">
            Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a better solution for people who needed reliable and
            accessible services. Starting as a small team with big ambitions, we launched our first product and quickly
            realized how much impact we could make. Over time, we expanded our expertise, improved our technology, and
            grew into a trusted company that continues to evolve every day.

            “Nike’s first sneakers”
        </h2>
        <p class="pk">
            The first Nike sneakers were released in 1972 under the name Nike Cortez. However, when talking about iconic models, the first legendary sneakers were the Nike Air Jordan 1, designed for Michael Jordan in 1985. Another important milestone was the Nike Air Tailwind (1979), the first running shoes with Nike Air cushioning technology.

Nike Air Tailwind (1979): The first running shoes with an air cushion in the sole, which became a technological breakthrough for the company.
Nike Air Jordan 1 (1985): The first model created specifically for basketball player Michael Jordan, which became a symbol of street style and a revolution in sportswear marketing.
